          Estimates for the climate impact of the web industry range from
          between 2% and 4% of global carbon <br /> emissions, roughly equivalent
          to the emissions of the airline industry. There are many complex factors<br
          /> in calculating the ecological impact of a website, but this guide includes
          a few tips for reducing the <br />environmental footprint of your docs
          site.

        <div class="intro-para">
          The good news is, choosing Starlight is a great start. According to
          the Website Carbon Calculator, this<br /> site is cleaner than 99% of web
          pages tested, producing 0.01g of CO₂ per page visit.
        </div>
        <h2 class="h2 main-h2" id="page-weight">Page Weight</h2>

        <p class="main-h2">
          The more data a web page transfers, the more energy resources it
          requires. In April 2023, the median web page required <br /> a user to
          download more than 2,000 KB according to data from the HTTP Archive.
        </p><br />

        <p class="main-h2">
          Starlight builds pages that are as lightweight as possible. For
          example, on a first visit, a user will download less than 50 KB <br />
          of compressed data — just 2.5% of the HTTP archive median. With a good
          caching strategy, subsequent navigations <br /> can download as little
          as 10 KB.
        </p><br />

        <h1 class="h1 main-h2" id="images">Images</h1>

        <p class="main-h2">
          While Starlight provides a good baseline, images you add to your docs
          pages can quickly increase your page weight. Starlight uses Astro’s
          optimized asset support to optimize local images in your Markdown and
          MDX files.
        </p>
        <p class="main-h2">
          Starlight is ready for you to add new content, or bring your existing
          files!
        </p><br /><br />

        <h3 class="h3 main-h2" id="ui-component">UI components</h3>

        <p class="main-h2">
          Components built with UI frameworks like React or Vue can easily add
          large amounts of JavaScript to a page. Because Starlight is built on
          Astro, components like this load zero client-side JavaScript by
          default thanks to Astro Islands.
